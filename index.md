## Research Experience
## Centre for Inflammation Biology & Cancer Immunology, King’s College London. `2019.04 - 2020.04`
- Research Topic: Investigating the functional consequences and molecular basis of monocyte modulation mediated by T regulatory cells<br>
•	Designed the experiments to reveal the modulation of Treg mediated-monocyte phenotype by low-dose IL-2 treatment<br>
•	Performed antibody titration experiments and detected the activity of hr IL-2 with pSTAT5 staining and T cell proliferation assay<br>
•	Isolated Tregs through cell sorting and performed co-culture of monocytes with Tregs<br>
•	Applied flow cytometry to observe the phenotypic changes and ELISA to detect cytokine production in Treg-mediated monocytes with or without IL-2 stimulation<br>
•	Generated histogram and density plots to analyse FACS data using FlowJo<br>
•	Performed pathway analysis software, DAVID and IPA, to analyse the RNAseq dataset of Treg-mediated monocytes; selected pathways and target genes<br>

## Department of Pharmacy & Medicine, Ocean University of China. <br> `2015.07 - 2018.07`
-Postgraduate Thesis Project: Immunomodulatory mechanisms on macrophages of a β-1,3/1,6-d-glucan (BG136) extracted from *Durvillaea antarctica* <br>
•	Studied the immunomodulating effects of macrophages by BG136 via measuring the phagocytosis function, ROS and NO release, cytokine production and pathway activation (NF-kB, MAPKs) in macrophages.<br>
•	Through the mechanistic study, it’s found that (1) BG136 binds to cell surface with FITC-labeled BG136; (2) BG136 binds to TLR4 on macrophages with a strong binding affinity determined by SPR technique; (3) BG136 modulates macrophage activity through TLR4 using siRNA technique.<br>
•	Studied the anti-tumor effects of BG136 on MCF-7 breast cancer tumor-bearing nude mice; the anti-tumor effects were measured by tumor volume, tumor weight, splenic index and peripheral CD4/CD8 ratio of tumor-bearing mice.

## Jiangsu Research Institute for Chinese Medicine.<br> `2014.09 - 2015.06`
-Undergraduate Thesis Project:<br>
•	Investigated the anti-inflammation effects of Nauclea Officinalis extract on macrophages
<br>•	Learned experimental design, biology statistics, compound isolation, cell culture techniques and experimental techniques on mice (tail bleeding and retro orbital blood withdrawal); I co-authored in two publications resulted from this work.<br>
